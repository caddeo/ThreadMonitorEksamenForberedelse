# ThreadMonitorEksamenForberedelse
Reference point for Thread with monitor (consumer/producer) and practice

- Notes : Very old project from when I was a second semester student, I tried to touch it up a bit, but there's still a lot of bugs 
and it's running in a endless thread hell.

Maybe later I will fix it up, and add a purpose to it - but it fullfilled the task we had back then.
